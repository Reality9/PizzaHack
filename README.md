Project from Maghimim 2015 camp for teaching about the SQL Injection vulnerability, and about SQL.

Further documentation is pending. Pull requests and help appreciated.

##What it is?

Using [SQLite emscripten'd to JavaScript](kripken.github.io/sql.js) and [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) this small website is here to educate people about SQL Injection. It runs locally and does not require any installations, only a static web server - additionally it can be accessed at http://benjamingr.github.io/PizzaHack/index.html .

## How do I use it?

There is an attached exercise file, currently it is in Hebrew. The tasks are:

 - Login to the site.
 - Login to the site as administrator.
 - List all the pizzas.
 - Remove the pizza causing the visa-spam.
 - Add a new Pizza.
 - Login as administrator.
 - Change the price of Pizzas to 10.
 
For obvious reasons, any "client side" tinkering (like using the developer tools) is prohibited.
